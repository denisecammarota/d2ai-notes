# 📘 Dive into Deep Learning (d2ai) notes

In this repository, I will keep some notes I have taken while going through the Dive into Deep Learning (d2ai) book (<https://d2l.ai/>), as well as some google colab notebooks I coded while going through the examples in the book, coded in Pytorch, for learning purposes. That is, not using the d2ai package provided by the authors.
