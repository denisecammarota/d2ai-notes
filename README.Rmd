## Dive into Deep Learning (d2ai) notes

In this repository, I will keep some notes I have taken while going through the Dive into Deep Learning (d2ai) book (<https://d2l.ai/>), as well as some google colab notebooks going through the examples in the book, coded in Pytorch. That is, not using the d2ai package provided by the authors. So far:

-   Chapter 3 Notebook: Linear regression with simulated data
-   Chapter 4 Notebook: Softmax regression with the Fashion-MNIST dataset
-   Chapter 5 Notebook: Multilayer perceptron for Kaggle House Price dataset
